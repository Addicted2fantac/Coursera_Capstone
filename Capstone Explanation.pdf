CAPSTONE PROJECT- THE BATTLE OF NEIGHBORHOOD
The Coursera Final Capstone Project

Background
According to Bloomberg News, the London Housing Market is in a rut. 
There has been a warning issued from the Bank of England that U.K. home values could fall as much as 30 percent in the event of a disorderly exit from the European Union. More specifically, four overlooked cracks suggest that the London market may be in worse shape than many realize: hidden price falls, record-low sales, homebuilder exodus and tax hikes addressing overseas buyers of homes in England and Wales.

Business Problem
The business problem we are currently posing is: how could we provide
support to homebuyers clientele in to purchase a suitable real estate in London
in this uncertain economic and financial scenario?
To solve this business problem, we are going to cluster London neighborhoods
in order to recommend venues and the current average price of real estate where
homebuyers can make a real estate investment. We will recommend profitable
venues according to amenities and essential facilities surrounding such venues
i.e. elementary schools, high schools, hospitals & grocery stores.

Data section
Data on London properties and the relative price paid data were extracted from
the HM Land Registry (http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/). The following fields
comprise the address data included in Price Paid Data: Postcode; PAON
Primary Addressable Object Name. Typically the house number or name;
SAON Secondary Addressable Object Name. If there is a sub-building, for
example, the building is divided into flats, there will be a SAON; Street;
Locality; Town/City; District; County.
To explore and target recommended locations across different venues according
to the presence of amenities and essential facilities, we will access data through
FourSquare API interface and arrange them as a dataframe for visualization. By
merging data on London properties and the relative price paid data from the HM 
Land Registry and data on amenities and essential facilities surrounding such
properties from FourSquare API interface, we will be able to recommend
profitable real estate investments.

Methodology section
The Methodology section will describe the main components of our analysis
and predication system. The Methodology section comprises four stages:
1. Collect Inspection Data
2. Explore and Understand Data
3. Data preparation and pre-processing
4. Modelling

1. Collect Inspection Data
After importing the necessary libraries, we download the data from the HM
Land Registry website. Before using data, we will have to explore and
understand it.

2. Explore and Understand Data
We read the dataset that we collected from the HM Land Registry website into a
pandas' data frame and display the first five rows
Our dataset consists of over 700000 rows and 16 columns. We will now prepare
and preprocess data accordingly.

3. Data preparation and preprocessing
At this stage, we prepare our dataset for the modeling process, opting for the
most suitable machine learning algorithm for our scope. Accordingly, we
perform the following steps:
 Rename the column names
 Format the date column
 Sort data by date of sale
 Select data only for the city of London
 Make a list of street names in London
 Calculate the street-wise average price of the property
 Read the street-wise coordinates into a data frame, eliminating recurring
word London from individual names
 Join the data to find the coordinates of locations which fit into client's
budget
 Plot recommended locations on London map along with current market
prices
We can now proceed to the Modeling phase. We will analyze neighborhoods to
recommend real estates where home buyers can make a real estate investment.
We will then recommend profitable venues according to amenities and essential
facilities surrounding such venues i.e. elementary schools, high schools,
hospitals & grocery stores.

4. Modeling
After exploring the dataset and gaining insights into it, we are ready to use the
clustering methodology to analyze real estates. We will use the k-means
clustering technique as it is fast and efficient in terms of computational cost, is
highly flexible to account for mutations in real estate market in London and is
accurate

Results and Discussion section
It is interesting to note that, although West London (Notting Hill, Kensington,
Chelsea, Marylebone) and North-West London (Hampsted) might be considered
highly profitable venues to purchase a real estate according to amenities and
essential facilities surrounding such venues i.e. elementary schools, high
schools, hospitals & grocery stores, South-West London (Wandsworth, Balham)
and North-West London (Isliington) are arising as next future elite venues with
a wide range of amenities and facilities. 
Accordingly, one might target underpriced real estates in these areas of London in order to make a business affair.
Second, we may analyze our results according to the five clusters we have
produced. Even though, all clusters could praise an optimal range of facilities
and amenities, we have found two main patterns. The first pattern we are
referring to, i.e. Clusters 0, 2 and 4, may target home buyers prone to live in
'green' areas with parks, waterfronts. Instead, the second pattern we are referring
to, i.e. Clusters 1 and 3, may target individuals who love pubs, theatres and
soccer.
